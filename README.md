This "game" is a social experiment, which proves, that Hotline Miami OST goes hard with any kind of stupid shiet.

In all seriousness, this project is only ~35% ready. I was planning on reworking "Game the Game", "Sralker" and a bit of "DCP" in Pygame so that player will unlock it after finishing colorblind mode.
But life stuff got in a way, as it always does. 

Hopefully, I will return to this game one day and finish it. 
Thank you all for patience and help <3

PS. I couldn't find button to add LICENSE.md so I might as well leave it here: you can modify and share it as you see fit. 
Just be aware, it is a full repo worth of pirated music with some code attached to it.
