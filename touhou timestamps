I can't even see the heart that's leaving me,
0:39
yes, I don't know
0:43 - swap player/earth to WHITE
I can't even get myself to move,

0:53
I'm just me and no more
0:56.5
Am I dreaming? Am I seeing nothing?
1:00
My words are useless even if I speak
1:03
I'm just tired of being sad,

1:34.5
Not even knowing myself

Even when I'm walking, I'm sick of it,
1:42
So how would I care for other people

I can't even get myself to move,
2:24
I continue to be washed down the cracks of time
2:27
I don't know anything about what's around me,
2:30
I am me, and that's it
2:34
Am I dreaming? Or seeing nothing?
2:37
My words are useless even if I speak
2:40.5
I'm just tired of being sad,
2:44
I should go on without feeling anything
2:47
Even if I were to speak these confusing words
2:51
My heart just won't pay attention
2:54
If I were to move,
2:58 - swap player/earth to BLACK
Everything would return and I’d turn it black

3:01
If I were to move, if I were to move
3:05
Then I'd break everything, I'd break everything
3:08
If I were to be sad, if I were to be sad
3:12 - swap player/earth to WHITE
Can my heart turn white?

3:15
I still don’t know about you,
3:19
About myself, about everything
3:22
If my eyes were to open,
3:26 - swap player/earth to BLACK
if I break everything, it just turns black
